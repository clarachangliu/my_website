At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). 

The GDP data I will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. I will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP.

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename

```

This chart illustrates that household expenditure accounts for the largest part of GDP and consistently increases from 1970 to 2010 across three countries. 

The rest of the GDP components differ from country to country. For example, Germany enjoys a trade surplus while the U.S. has an increasingly sizable trade deficit.

This chart illustrates the evolution over time of GDP components as a % of total GDP. We can notice that while the US has known some small changes, India has experienced large shifts in some of its components.

India has seen a boom in its gross capital formation illustrating large inflows of capital that came in the Indian economy. The share of its household expenditure declined. This decline is relative to GDP so it is likely that Indian GDP increased highly while household expenditure stagnated.

Germany has considerably increased the share of its Net exports, illustrating the success of the German manufacturing industry.

The US has increased its share of household expenditure and Gross capital formation, while its Net Exports and Government expenditures decreased. Illustrating the liberalization of the US economy and how it relies on its internal consumption.
