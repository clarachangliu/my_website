<h1>CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data</h1>
<p>In early December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in China and then rapidly spread throughout the globe, putting the world on alert.
There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In this project, I investigate how COVID-19 mortality risk differs between genders across different age groups.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># URL link to CDC to download data
url &lt;- &quot;https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&quot;

covid_data &lt;- vroom::vroom(url)%&gt;% # If 
  clean_names()</code></pre>
<p>Next, I produced two graphs that show death % rate:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not</li>
<li>by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>These two graphs reveal several patterns that shed some light on our understanding of the relationship between age, sex, COVID-19 mortality and comorbidities.
First, I find that men are more at risk for worse outcomes and death, independent of age, with COVID-19.
Second, the presence of comorbidities increases the risk of COVID-19 mortality regardless of gender and age.
Lastly, the risk of COVID-19 mortality increases with age for both men and women.</p>
