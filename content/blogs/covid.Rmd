# CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
options(knitr.duplicate.label = "allow")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(

```


```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}

In early December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in China and then rapidly spread throughout the globe, putting the world on alert. 

There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In this project, I investigate how COVID-19 mortality risk differs between genders across different age groups.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If 
  clean_names()

```

Next, I produced two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
2. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, co-morbidities}
#by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not

covid_data %>% 
  filter(!medcond_yn %in% c("Missing", "Unknown")) %>% 
  filter(!sex %in% c("Missing", "Unknown", "Other", NA)) %>% 
  filter(!age_group %in% c("Missing", "Unknown", "Other")) %>% 
  mutate(death_rate_binary = case_when(death_yn == "Yes" ~ 1, 
                                       TRUE ~ 0)) %>%
  group_by(age_group, sex, medcond_yn) %>% 
  summarise(death_percent = mean(death_rate_binary)*100) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(comorbidities = case_when(medcond_yn == "Yes" ~ "With Comorbidities", 
                            TRUE ~ "Without Comorbidities")) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(death_percent,  age_group), stat = "identity", fill = "#4863A0", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_text(aes(death_percent, y = age_group, label = round(death_percent, 1)), hjust = -0.1,  size = 3) + 
  facet_grid(comorbidities ~  sex) +
    labs(
    
    x = "", 
    y = "", 
    title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and presence of co-morbidities"
    
  ) + 
   theme_bw() +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size=11)) 
   
```

```{R, ICU}
#by age group, sex, and whether the patient had  admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.

covid_data %>% 
  mutate(death_rate_binary = case_when(death_yn == "Yes" ~ 1, 
                                       TRUE ~ 0)) %>%
  group_by(age_group, sex, icu_yn) %>% 
  summarise(death_percent = mean(death_rate_binary)*100) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(!icu_yn %in% c("Missing", "Unknown")) %>% 
  filter(!sex %in% c("Missing", "Unknown", "Other", NA)) %>% 
  filter(!age_group %in% c("Missing", "Unknown", "Other")) %>% 
  mutate(icu_admitted = case_when(icu_yn == "Yes" ~ "Admitted to ICU", 
                            TRUE ~ "NO ICU")) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(death_percent,  age_group), stat = "identity", fill = "#E77471", alpha = 0.8) + 
  geom_text(aes(death_percent, y = age_group, label = round(death_percent, 1)), hjust = -0.1,  size = 3) + 
  facet_grid(icu_admitted ~  sex) + 
  labs(
    
    x = "", 
    y = "", 
    title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU"
    
  ) + 
   theme_bw() + 
     theme(plot.title = element_text(size=11))

```

These two graphs reveal several patterns that shed some light on our understanding of the relationship between age, sex, COVID-19 mortality and comorbidities. 
First, I find that men are more at risk for worse outcomes and death, independent of age, with COVID-19. 
Second, the presence of comorbidities increases the risk of COVID-19 mortality regardless of gender and age. 
Lastly, the risk of COVID-19 mortality increases with age for both men and women.
