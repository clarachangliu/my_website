Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. 

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). 

In this project, I can will explore whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions.

I will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. 

First, I will download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 

```

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009.  

As illustrated by the above plots, the the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions. A yield curve flattening can mean a recession is coming in the US. 


```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

         To=ymd(to),

  mutate(res_neg = case_when(diff < 0 ~ diff, 
                         TRUE ~ 0)) 
  
   df %>% ggplot(aes(date, diff)) +

  geom_rug(data = subset(df,res == "Pos"), sides = "b", alpha = 0.9, size = 0.2, col = "#3299CC", inherit.aes = TRUE) + 
  geom_rug(data = subset(df,res == "neg"), sides = "b", alpha = 0.9, size = 0.1, col = "#E77471", inherit.aes = TRUE) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#E77471', '#3299CC')) +
    labs(
    x = "", 
    y = "Difference (10 year - 3 month) yield in %", 
    title = "Yields Curve Inversion: 10-year minus 3-month Treasury Rate",
    subtitle = "Differences in % points monthly average \nShaded areas correspond to recessions" 
    
  ) + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 year", date_labels =  "%Y") +
  theme_bw()  + 
     
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=8, face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_text(size =6, face = "italic"), axis.text.y.left = element_text(hjust=1, size = 6), axis.title.y = element_text( size = 7),   axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(size = 6),  legend.position = "none")
    



```

The last plot shows that since 1999, short-term (3 months) yield was more than longer term (10 years) debt when there was a recession.
